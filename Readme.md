## Introduction

This is a Very Simple Rating App built using Node.js, Express.js, and Pug as the template engine. The project was a way for me to explore and become more familiar with the Node.js framework.

Designed mainly for rating and storing played board games, the app offers an intuitive interface to add, rate, and filter records. Since it isnâ€™t strictly tailored to board games, it can be easily adapted to manage other collections like video games, books, or virtually any type of record.
